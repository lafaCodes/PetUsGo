# PetUsGo (Pet's Go!)

PetUsGo is a cross-platform modern gamified app designed to engage pets and their owners more in the pet community. The app includes features such as pet activity tracker integration, augmented reality (AR) experiences, health and wellness monitoring, achievements and rewards, and community engagement.

## Features

1. **Pet Activity Tracker Integration**: Connect with popular pet activity trackers to monitor your pet's daily activities, such as steps taken, distance traveled, and calories burned. This data can be synced with the app to provide a comprehensive overview of your pet's health and fitness.

2. **Augmented Reality (AR) Features**:
   - **Virtual Playtime**: Engage pets with virtual toys and games that appear in the real world through the camera.
   - **AR Training**: Provide interactive training sessions where virtual trainers guide pet owners through exercises and commands.
   - **Pet Updates**: Use the camera to capture images and videos of pets, which can be enhanced with AR effects and shared within the community.

3. **Health and Wellness Monitoring**: Utilize the app's camera to track your pet's physical condition. For example, you could use image recognition to monitor changes in weight, coat condition, or any visible health issues.

4. **Achievements and Rewards**: Incorporate AR elements into the rewards system. For example, when a pet owner completes a challenge, they could unlock a virtual badge or trophy that appears in AR.

5. **Community Engagement**: Use AR to create interactive community events, such as virtual pet meetups or AR scavenger hunts where pet owners can explore their surroundings and complete challenges together.

### Explanation
```
1. **Core**: Contains core functionalities that are used across the app, such as models, services, and utilities.
2. **Features**: Each feature has its own folder containing screens, widgets, and providers specific to that feature.
3. **Widgets**: Contains common widgets that are used across multiple features.
```

### Benefits
```
- **Scalability**: This structure allows you to easily add new features without cluttering the main directory.
- **Maintainability**: Each feature is self-contained, making it easier to manage and understand.
- **Reusability**: Common components and utilities are centralized, promoting reuse across the app.
```

This structure is more aligned with industry standards and will help you manage the complexity as your app grows.
